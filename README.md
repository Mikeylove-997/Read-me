Highly analytical and bicultural fluent Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) student at Santa Clara University, targeting Summer 2026 internships across BA/DA, Product Management, and Consulting roles.
As a Canadian-Chinese professional, I bring a unique, dual-market perspective that ensures strong analytical and communication skills across diverse international teams. I aim to combine my past client-facing experience from Canada 🇨🇦 with the technical expertise developed during my MSBA in the U.S 🇺🇸 to define strategic, data-driven solutions and contribute directly to organizational success.
My MSBA training provides a strong foundation in the practical, in-demand skills needed to translate data into action:
  Data Analysis & Visualization: Currently developing expertise in data analytics with the application of tools like SQL and Python to extract, analyze, and communicate insights using dashboards and compelling data stories (Tableau)
  Metric Design & Quantification: Ability to define key business metrics, assess performance, and apply rigorous methodologies to measure the impact of product and business decisions.
 Execution & Communication: Translating complex technical findings into clear, actionable business recommendations for executive stakeholders (a key skill for PM and Consulting).
 Project Management: Proven ability to scope projects, coordinate tasks, manage cross-functional stakeholders, and drive delivery from concept to completion.

I am actively networking with alumni and recruiters seeking top-tier talent for the Summer 2026 application cycle. I am open to any opportunities in the U.S, Canada and Hong Kong. Let's connect to discuss opportunities where my data expertise and global mindset can drive impact!
