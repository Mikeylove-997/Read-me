Highly analytical and bicultural MS in Business Analytics (MSBA) student at Santa Clara University, targeting Summer 2026 internships across Business Analytics, Data Analytics, Product Management, and Consulting.

As a Canadian–Chinese professional 🇨🇦, I bring a dual-market perspective with strong analytical and stakeholder communication skills across international teams. I combine client-facing experience in Canada with technical training in the U.S. 🇺🇸 to deliver data-driven, strategic solutions.

**Core strengths include:**
- Data analysis & visualization using SQL, Python, and Tableau
- Metric design and performance measurement
- Translating technical insights into executive-ready recommendations
- Project coordination across cross-functional stakeholders

I am actively networking with various professionals and am open to opportunities in the U.S., Canada, and Hong Kong.
